+ Move grid implementation from SmartRect to CanvasItem.
  |--> Done, BUT 'looseRestriction()' is necessary on SmartRect.
+ Improve CanvasItem event notification (probably extend CanvasItem from wxObject, and use wxEvent).
  |--> Done, BUT 'extend' not implemented (I think it is not necessary).
- Implement ZoomControl.
- Implement Auto-scrolling.
  |--> improve getAreaUpdate() function (CanvasItem)
  |--> use wxGetMousePosition() to obtain mouse position in screen coordinates
       and later convert to canvas coordinates. This new mouse position is used
       in pressed item.
